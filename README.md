## About the Project

This repository provides a simple yet effective pipeline for **speech-to-text conversion**:

1. **Audio Input** – Captures speech from microphone or pre-recorded audio files.  
2. **Transcription** – Uses Google Speech Recognition API via the `SpeechRecognition` library.  
3. **Output** – Returns the spoken words in plain text format, ready to use in applications.  

Perfect for students, developers, and researchers interested in **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **voice-enabled systems**.
